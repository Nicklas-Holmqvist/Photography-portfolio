# Nicklasfoto.se

## My new webpage for my photography portfolio

This page is a onepage and here I have tried out to toggle classes to show och hide the different divs.
It is like a simple SPA but without the goodies of React or other SPA frameworks. All in HTML, CSS and JS.
I am quite happy with the outcome, but if I am gonna fix something it would be to get the darkmode to work when I switch real pages.
